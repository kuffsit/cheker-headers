ðŸ”¥ check_security_headers
Description
This script checks if a given URL has the recommended security headers implemented.

Usage
Single URL Check
To check a single URL, run the script and provide the URL as an input.

```sh
python3 check_headers.py
Enter the URL to check: https://example.com

Notes

It then checks the server response for the presence of security headers.
If any security headers are missing, the script prints a message indicating which headers are missing.
If any headers have incorrect values, the script prints a message indicating which headers have incorrect values and what the expected values are.
